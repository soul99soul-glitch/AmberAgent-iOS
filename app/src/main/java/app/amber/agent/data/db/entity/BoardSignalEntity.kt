/**
 * Raw signal captured by any collector (notification / calendar / feishu / chat / time).
 *
 * This is the pre-aggregation store. The SignalAggregator reads from here, runs dedup and
 * weight-based filtering, and the BoardAgent then reasons over the filtered batch.
 *
 * [sourceType] is a free-form string (notification / calendar / feishu_msg / feishu_doc /
 * chat / time) rather than an enum so new collectors can add entries without touching
 * migrations. The value is defined as SignalSourceType constants in code.
 *
 * [sourceRef] is the external identifier of the originating object (status bar key,
 * calendar event id, feishu message id, etc.). Combined with [sourceType] it forms the
 * natural key used by the deduplicator.
 *
 * [contentHash] is a hash of the meaningful content of the signal. Two signals with the
 * same content hash from the same source should be treated as duplicates even if they
 * arrive at different times with different [sourceRef] values (e.g. a re-posted
 * notification after the app cleared the previous one).
 *
 * [processed] flips to true once a BoardAgent run has considered this signal. Processed
 * signals are retained for a limited window for context and then pruned by the scheduler
 * to keep the table bounded.
