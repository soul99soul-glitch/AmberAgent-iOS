/**
 * Phase 2 M2.2 — Loader for host-defined signing shims.
 *
 * Profiles can declare `scripts.sign_request.call_page_fn = "__amberXxx"`
 * but the function must actually exist in the page's JS realm. For sites
 * whose own bundle exposes a usable signing function (rare), the page has
 * it natively. For sites that don't (Bilibili — WBI computation is split
 * across the bundle and isn't reachable as a single global), AmberAgent
 * ships a **host-defined shim** that defines the function inside the
 * page's origin and computes the signature itself.
 *
 * SAFETY: shims are loaded from `assets/webmount/shims/<profile-id>.js`
 * — bundled with the APK, not user-supplied. A profile can only DECLARE
 * the function name; it cannot ship its own shim source. User-imported
 * profiles can reference an existing built-in shim only if their
 * `call_page_fn:<name>` permission matches an opted-in entry (see L4).
 *
 * Shim source is read once and cached. The Kotlin side passes the source
 * string to [app.amber.feature.webmount.primitives.SessionHandle.injectHostShim],
 * which re-runs `evaluateJavascript` on the WebView's current page. Shims
 * are idempotent (each guards against re-definition) so re-injection
 * after navigation is safe.
