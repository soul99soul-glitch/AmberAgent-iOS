/**
 * One website/service plugged into the WebMount framework.
 *
 * **Standalone adapters** (the M1.6 baseline shape, used by all 7 shipped sites):
 * the adapter owns its own state, [WebMountManager] holds per-station state in
 * shared prefs, calls [probe] / [writeProbe] to mutate it, and the adapter's
 * [tools] are surfaced into the agent's tool catalog.
 *
 * **Wrapping-adapter escape hatch**: the optional [externalStateFlow] override
 * lets an adapter mirror state from a manager that lives outside the framework
 * (so it shows up in the unified panel without owning its own probe state).
 * No shipped adapter uses this path today — it's kept available for future
 * integrations that need to surface an externally-managed station's state.
 * (Note: the iCloud experimental feature is intentionally **not** wrapped —
 * it stays as a separate standalone Settings entry per the user's directive
 * from Phase 1 M1.2.)
 *
 * ## Tool output shape convention
 *
 * Two shapes coexist in the catalog; adapter authors should match the
 * appropriate style and avoid mixing.
 *
 *  - **Browser Primitives (`wm_*`)**: RPC-style nested envelope
 *    `{session_id, ok?, result: {...}}` — `result` holds the bridge's reply.
 *    The wrap is there because the wm tools sit on top of an in-page JS RPC
 *    and the reply shape is bridge-defined.
 *
 *  - **Site adapter tools (`hn_*`, `reddit_*`, `feishu_docs_*`, etc.)**:
 *    flat query-style. List tools surface `{count, items|articles|videos: [...]}`
 *    with optional pagination cursors at the top level. Detail tools surface
 *    object fields flat at the top level (`{id, title, content, ...}`).
 *    Write tools return flat success fields (`{ok, id, ...}`) — no nested
 *    `response` wrapper around upstream payloads.
 *
 * Reasoning: primitives are inherently RPC (one in-page call, one reply);
 * adapter tools are query-style and the agent reasons over their fields
 * directly. Matching this distinction keeps tool outputs predictable.
